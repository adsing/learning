Monitoring

Prometheus: 
    Open source monitoring/alerting toolkit.
    Collects and stored metrics as time series (TS) i.e. metric info is store with timestamp (of when recorded) along with optional key-value labels.

    Features:
        multi-dimension data model with TS data identified by metric and key-value labels
        PromQL - query language
        single server nodes are autonomous so reliable even when distributes network is out
        Pull data over HTTP or push data via gateway to server

    Works well for recording numeric TS data esp for micro-services with multi-dimension data.
                reliable even when network outages as the server is standalone
    Not good for 100% accurate data as it may occasionally drop some data.

    So reliable but not 100% accurate.
    UI on top is typically Grafana

    
Splunk:
    capture, index, search, monitor, analyze machine generated data (e.g. logs)
    web interface for query (Splunk Query Language)
    UI is grafana
    
Grafana:
    Visibility stack for making dashboards on data from Prometheus/splunk etc.
    API to integrate with databases (Snowflake/Postgres), Kafka, Databog etc.
