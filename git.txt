Git has 3 stages/parts:: working dir -> staging area -> repo

1. working dir :: create/eidt/delete files  (possible to have untracked files)
2. staging area :: list changes made to working dir  "$ git add"
                                                      $ git status
                                                      $ git diff <filename>
3. repo :: store the changes as different versions by "$ git commit"
                                                       $ git log      # 40 char SHA hash
