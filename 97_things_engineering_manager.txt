1. One-on-One Retrospectives 
    - EOM 1-on-1 should be restrospective (what went well and didn't -or- glad-sad-mad items; how to improve; try for next 3 weekly 1-on-1. What's valuable in meeting & whats not. Do min and max value. Ask questions - whys)
    - Keep it relevant & fresh. Meet often or less if reqd.
    - prep for all meetings, secret/spoken agenda/goal, duration, communication mode (face/talk/chat or walk/lunch)
