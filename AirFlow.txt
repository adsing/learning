AirFlow - Job scheduler

< https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHATHSB_450 >
2015 - AirBnB
2016 - Apache Incubator

Pipelines - series of task with job dependecies (DAG)
UI - DAG name, turn DAG on/off, schedule, job status (passed, run, fail, wait) + additional views (Gantt),
     history of jobs (forget old history if required to rerun; task logs on S3)

Deployment 
  - Metadata (SQL DB - SQL Server/Postgres)
  - WebServer (Flask - talks to Metadata DB)   
  - Scheduler (Python DAGs + queue)
  - Worker Queue (Celery - distributed task queue with Redis/RabbitMQ)
  - Nodes
  
Building pipeline
     - Build DAG (unique name)
     - start date (will run for hist dates)
     - schedule interval (min start time in minute)
     - default_args (for all tasks in pipeline)
     - max_active_runs (# of parallel runs - safe=1)
     - concurrency (# of tasks within pipeline that run in parallel)
