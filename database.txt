Database basic

Normal forms
------------
First NF: 
	1. Must have primary key
	2. Repeating groups not allowed (e.g. "4 banana, 3 apples")
	3. Relying on row order for information (e.g. data sorted by height but height is not a first class column)
	4. Mixed data type in a column (DB won't allow it anyway unless your datatype is char/varchar)
	
Second NF: Non-key attribute dependent only on entire primary key

Third  NF/Boyce-Codd normal form: Each attribute depend only on entire primary key and nothing else.

Fourth NF: Any multivalued dependency is only on the key
Fifth  NF: Should not be possible to describe table as join of 2 separate tables (i.e. data can not be denormalized any more).


Why have denormalised data? For avoiding joins to speed up query in single table. Rish of inconsistent delete/update/insert.
